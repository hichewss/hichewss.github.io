        allowing researchers to use the lab's <u>ColBERT package</u> on their
        own data. This notebook has been high in demand, and I'm currently
        working on making enhancements to the notebook as the ColBERT package is
        being further developed. I have also helped the lab with their name

        In spring 2023, I was also selected to be a <u>section leader</u> for
        Stanford's introductory computer science courses. I've led 50-minute
        discussions for about 20 students to help them practice the basics of
        C++ and Python. I find it very rewarding knowing I'm helping someone
        learn how to code for the first time.

        This past summer, I've been a <u>software engineering intern</u> at
        <a class="gray-text" href="https://www.playgroundrl.com" target="_blank"
          >PlaygroundRL</a
        >, a startup that combines a gaming website with opportunities to gather
        research data. I've helped to build the website from the ground up as a
        <u>full-stack developer</u>, solving bugs and implementing new features.
        This internship made me very excited about <u>web development</u> and
        actually motivated me to build this website.

        school. It is a spinoff of the popular aim training game Aim Labs on
        Steam. I liked this project because it required us to take all the
        skills we had learned throughout the quarter and apply it in a creative
        manner, and the final result truly felt like a team effort. This class
        as a whle made me
        <u>realize the value in working within a group of diverse talents</u>,
        <u>shaping the positive way</u> in which I now view
        <u>collaborating</u> with others.
