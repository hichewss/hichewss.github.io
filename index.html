          I'm a rising junior at Stanford studying computer science and biology.
          As someone who loves building things and solving problems, I'm looking
          to see what software engineering careers are out there for me.

          I've gone from having no experience to publishing high demand Colab
          notebooks as an NLP research assistant, educating over 20 students on
          C++ and Python data structures and algorithms for Stanford's
          introductory CS courses, and developing full-stack implementations as
          a software engineering intern at a startup. I'm currently hoping to
          explore careers in industry further, specifically in relation to
          systems and cybersecurity. <br />

        school. It is a spinoff of the popular aim training game Aim Labs on
        Steam. I liked this project because it required us to take all the
        skills we had learned throughout the quarter and apply it in a creative
        manner, and the final result truly felt like a team effort. This class
        as a whle made me
        <u>realize the value in working within a group of diverse talents</u>,
        <u>shaping the positive way</u> in which I now view
        <u>collaborating</u> with others.

        I have a solid background in Python, C++/C, React, HTML5/CSS,
        Javascript, GraphQL, and SQL.

        In terms of software, I'm comfortable with Github, Linux/Unix, Jupyter
