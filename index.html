      <p>
        My name is Chuyi Zhang and I'm a
        <u>rising junior at Stanford University</u>
        studying computer science and biology. I never thought I would be
        studying anything engineering-related coming into college, but here I
        am! I'm not exactly sure what I want to be doing post-undergrad, so I've
        been using these few years to explore my many options, including
        <u>software engineering, research, and teaching</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have learned about myself from these experiences is that I like
        the <u>balance of working independently and in team environments</u>. I
        also realize I like the aspects of <u>being creative</u> and
        <u>getting to know my team members outside of work</u>. In my free time,
        I spend a lot of time dancing on campus and eating good food around the
        area.

        Since spring of 2023, I've been working as a
        <u>research assistant</u> with Stanford Future Data Systems (founders of

        allowing researchers to use the lab's <u>ColBERT package</u> on their
        own data. This notebook has been high in demand, and I'm currently
        working on making enhancements to the notebook as the ColBERT package is
        being further developed. I have also helped the lab with their name

        I'm looking forward to continue working with them!

        In spring 2023, I was also selected to be a <u>section leader</u> for
        Stanford's introductory computer science courses. I've led 50-minute
        discussions for about 20 students to help them practice the basics of
        C++ and Python. I find it very rewarding knowing I'm helping someone
        learn how to code for the first time.

        This past summer, I've been a <u>software engineering intern</u> at
        <a class="gray-text" href="https://www.playgroundrl.com" target="_blank"
          >PlaygroundRL</a
        >, a startup that combines a gaming website with opportunities to gather
        research data. I've helped to build the website from the ground up as a
        <u>full-stack developer</u>, solving bugs and implementing new features.
        This internship made me very excited about <u>web development</u> and
        actually motivated me to build this website.

        >, a final team assignment for CS107E, the first systems class I took at
        school. It is a spinoff of the popular aim training game Aim Labs on
        Steam. I liked this project because it required us to take all the
        skills we had learned throughout the quarter and apply it in a creative
        manner, and the final result truly felt like a team effort. This class
        as a whle made me
        <u>realize the value in working within a group of diverse talents</u>,
        <u>shaping the positive way</u> in which I now view
        <u>collaborating</u> with others.

        I have other small projects sprinkled here and there through which I've

        I have a solid background in Python, C++/C, React, HTML5/CSS,
        Javascript, GraphQL, and SQL.

        In terms of software, I'm comfortable with Github, Linux/Unix, Jupyter

        I also enjoy learning new languages and would consider myself a
