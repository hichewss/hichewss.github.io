      <p>
        My name is Chuyi Zhang and I'm a <u>rising junior at Stanford University</u>
        studying computer science and biology. I never thought I would be
        studying anything engineering-related coming into college, but here I
        am! I'm not exactly sure what I want to be doing post-undergrad, so I've
        been using these few years to explore my many options, including
        <u>software engineering, research, and teaching</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have learned about myself from these experiences is that I like
        the <u>balance of working independently and in team environments</u>. I also
        realize I like the aspects of <u>being creative</u> and <u>getting to know my team
        members outside of work</u>. In my free time, I spend a lot of time dancing
        on campus and eating good food around the area.

        Since spring of 2023, I've been working as a <u>research assistant</u> with
        Stanford Future Data Systems (founders of
        <a class="gray-text" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14024"
          >Demonstrate-Search-Predict</a
        >, an NLP framemwork taught and used in Stanford's NLP classes).
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently

        a Colab notebook on the lab's

          >Github page</a
        >
        allowing researchers to use the lab's <u>ColBERT package</u> on their own data.
        This notebook has been high in demand, and I'm currently working on
        making enhancements to the notebook as the ColBERT package is being
        further developed. I have also helped the lab with their name rebranding
        using by

        their new logo with Adobe Illustrator. They're pretty cool people, and
        I'm looking forward to continue working with them!

        In spring 2023, I was also selected to be a <u>section leader</u> for Stanford's
        introductory computer science courses. I've led 50-minute discussions
        for about 20 students to help them practice the basics of C++ and
        Python. I find it very rewarding knowing I'm helping someone learn how
        to code for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This past summer, I've been a <u>software engineering intern</u> at
        <a class="gray-text" href="https://www.playgroundrl.com">PlaygroundRL</a
        >, a startup that combines a gaming website with opportunities to gather
        research data. I've helped to build the website from the ground up as a
        <u>full-stack developer</u>, solving bugs and implementing new features. This
        internship made me very excited about <u>web development</u> and actually
        motivated me to build this website.

        I have a solid background in Python, C++/C, React, HTML5/CSS,
        Javascript, GraphQL, and SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of software, I'm comfortable with Github, Linux/Unix, Jupyter
        notebooks, and the Microsoft Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy learning new languages and would consider myself a
        <u>quick-learner</u>. I am comfortable working in fast-paced and collaborative
        settings and <u>adapt well</u> to the needs of a team.
